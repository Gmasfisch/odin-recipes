	<h4>Preparation</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Prepare the Bologneses Meat Sauce</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare the soffrito</li>
			<p>Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in saute pan with butter and cook over medium heat until onion turns pale gold</p>
			<li>Add the other ingredients</li>
			<p>Add the beef, pork, and sausage to the soffritto and increase the heat to high. Cook until browned. Sprinkle with the ground clove, cinnamon, and pepper.</p>
			<li>Add the tomatoes</li>
			<p>Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. If you are using whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce.</p>
			<li>Add the milk and simmer</li>
			<p>Add the milk, season with sea salt, then turn down the heat and let simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at least every 20 minutes. Whenever the sauce simmers down to the point that it is sticking to the bottom of the pan, just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom and continue to cook.</p>
		</ol>
		<li>Make the Bechamel Sauce</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Make the roux</li>
			<p>Heat the milk until almost boiling in a heavy bottomed sauce pan.</p>
			<p>In a separate pan melt the unsalted butter with the flour over low heat. Stir rapidly with a spoon. Cook this for 1 minute and then remove from the heat.</p>
			<li>Add half the milk to the roux</li>
			<p>Slowly add half the hot milk to your butter and flours mixture. During this process stir constantly.</p>
			<li>Add the remaining milk and thicken the sauce</li>
			<p>Return the milk, butter, flour mixture to low heat until the sauce begins to thicken</p>
			<p>Add the remaining milk slowly while stirring working it into the thickened sauce</p>
			<p>Continue to stir until it comes to a boil</p>
			<li>Season, then stir</li>
			<p>Season with some sea salt, and continue stirring until the right consistency has developed.</p>
			<p>If any lumps form, beat them out rapidly with a whisk until they dissolve.</p>
			<p>Remove from heat</p>
		</ol>
		<li>Prepare the Lasagna</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 375F</li>
			<li>Cook the lasagna noodles</li>
			<p> Cook the lasagna according to instructions. About 8 minutes in 6 quarts of boiling salted water. Drain, rinse with cold water.</p>
			<p>Lay the individual lasagna noodles out on kitchen towels, not touching, so they do not stick together while you layer the casserole</p>
			<li>Layer the lasagna</li>
			<p>Spread a little olive oil around the inside of a 13x9-inch baking pan. Make sure your baking pan is non-reactive - pyrex or stainless steel.</p>
			<p>Do not use an aluminum pan as it will react with the acidity of the sauce and ruin the flavor.</p>
			<p>Put a layer of lasagna noodles down first. Layer on a third of the bolognese sauce, then a third of the bechamel sauce.</p>
			<p>Sprinkle with grated parmesan. Repeat two more times. Top with a final layer of noodles and sprinkle with grated Parmesan</p>
			<li>Bake</li>
			<p>Tent the casserole with aluminum foil. Put lasagna into the middle rack of a pre-heated 375F oven.</p>
			<p>bake for 20 to 30 minutes, until the top begins to get lightly browned</p>
			<p>Remove from oven and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.</p>
